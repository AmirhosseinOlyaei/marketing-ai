- #### How to approach the project
    - **Review the mock-up and pages as a team**:
        - The mock is already designed and handed to your team. The team will be meeting as a group to review the designs and discuss strategy of approaching the work.
    - **Based on the design**, the team will [create milestones (Epics) and issues in ZenHub](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/f23c1---ai-marketing-app-6400b4701fdc560025f4ca78/board) **and** get approval to proceed with the rest of the steps.
- **Develop Your Solution:**
    - Starting working on the issues. For coding I strongly recommend webstorm and [connect it to GitHub](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiVtPDoiov9AhVDk4kEHcq4Az0QwqsBegQIDBAF&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DiV0iW8L6yt8&usg=AOvVaw3vCNj-5zjNSuWKcep-UDDf) — **your team will be working on the same repo, on different branches**
- **Iterate on project and collaborate on ZenHub**: During every group session, check-in on your respective progress, collaborate (or peer-code) with webstorm to confirm you’re on track for your respective goals.
- **Q/A and prepare Production Version**: After the work is done, all team members will merge their work and fork the repo to their personal GitHub.
- **Submit your work:**
    - From your personal GitHub, push the work to Vercel, then submit the following in Moodle:
        - Your slide deck with a summary of the work you’ve done
        - Your public GitHub link (test that you can visit this link in an incognito window)
        - Your public Vercel link (test that you can visit this link in an incognito window)
